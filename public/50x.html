<h1>An error occurred.</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, the server just encountered an error. There's a chance that a stray cosmic electromagnetic wave/particle made it through the atmosphere and flipped a bit on the server. Or there's a bug in my code somewhere. Both equally likely ... ok, the latter is significantly more likely. Either way, try reloading the page. If that doesn't change anything, try again tomorrow. Or next week. Solar activity will have decreased by then. :)</p>
