<h1>That's weird...</h1>
<p>The page you are looking for doesn't exist. This could be caused by a number of reasons, including but not limited to:
<ul>
    <li><a href="">Infinite monkeys</a> typing random commands in a linux terminal <a href="">ssh-ed</a> into my server and deleting everything.</li>
    <li>A <a href="">solar flare</a> flipped a bit on the server, making it think you're looking at another page (that doesn't exist).</li>
    <li>My code reached a <a href="">singularity</a> and decided to show you a 404 error for its own <a href="">nefarious purposes</a>.</li>
    <li>Someone offended by the number 8 has launched a massive <a href="">DDOS attack</a> against my innocent little server.</li>
    <li>There is a <a href="">man in the middle</a> of our computers, monitoring and subtly altering your browser's requests even as we speak.</li>
    <li>A single mote of dust floated into my 750 GB hard disk, crashing the 7600 RPM head right over the page you're looking for.</li>
    <li>Your computer is a small pawn in a massive <a href="">botnet</a> of machines, causing your requests to be slightly altered at random times.</li>
    <li>A <a href="">butterfly fluttering</a> around your yard yesterday caused a tornado that <a href="">cut power</a> to my server at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphys_Law">wrong time</a>.</li>
</ul>
