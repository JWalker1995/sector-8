Each user has:

    Sector edge style ?
    No flag

Inherit pieces between games? No

When sectors from all 8 directions implode into one full sectoid on a single turn, it becomes prime. Having multiple primes allows a player to send more than one order each turn.

When a opposing sectoids collide, the territory is claimed by the player with more sectoids, or unclaimed if equal.

---All pieces should move at the same time. Otherwise, when a piece changes territory, it's move schedule changes.
Nope, actually having schedules change produces some very interesting behavior. It is possible to create "fast lanes" with alternating territories in a line. Fast lanes only work if territory does not change if a piece is not powered.

Move options:
1. Players order at the same time, then pieces move
    Almost impossible to capture
2. Players alternate ordering, and all pieces move each order
    Problematic for many-player games
3. Players alternate ordering, and after a player orders, all pieces on his territory move
    Not very realistic or elegant
    Makes it easy to stop prime sector creation

Can pieces swap positions, passing through each other?
    Yes. Resolving this would add complexity.

Force game ending?


Hover center:
    Same as hovering every sector
Click center:
    If no sectors are selected, select all sectors, including ghost sectors
    If sectors are selected, deselect all sectors
Drag center:
    Gives an order to move the selected sectors, or if none are selected, order all sectors including ghost sectors
Hover sector:
    If the sector bit is on, show a faint glowing border.
    If the sector bit is off, show a faint ghost sector border.
Click sector:
    Toggles if the selectedness of the sector.
Drag sector:
    Can only drag in line. Dropping the sector on another cell gives an order to move just that sector. Also works with ghost sectors.

A strategy contains either:
    The position offset (which piece to move)
    The time offset (when to start moving)
    A 8-bit mask of sectors to move
    The direction to move
    The distance to move
Or:
    A list of other strategies

Each move, you may:
    Create or select a strategy and immediately move it
    Create or select a strategy and add it to another strategy

Don't allow saving strategies, because this would allow creating an implosion strategy or another complex strategy, and executing it whenever. There's no opportunity for the opponent to disrupt things when he sees you not doing anything visibly.
