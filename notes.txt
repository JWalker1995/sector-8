Each user has:
    A primary color for centers / territory
    Sector color
    Sector edge style ?
    No flag

Inherit pieces between games? No

When sectors from all 8 directions implode into one full sectoid on a single turn, it becomes prime.
Having multiple primes DOES NOT allow a player to send more than one order each turn.

When a multiple sectoids combine, the territory is claimed by the player with more sectoids, or unclaimed if equal.

---All pieces should move at the same time. Otherwise, when a piece changes territory, its move schedule changes.
Nope, actually having schedules change produces some very interesting behavior. It is possible to create "fast lanes" with alternating territories in a line. Fast lanes only work if territory does not change if a piece is not powered.

Move options:
1. Players order at the same time, then pieces move
    Almost impossible to capture
2. Players alternate ordering, and all pieces move each order
    Problematic for many-player games
3. Players alternate ordering, and after a player orders, all pieces on his territory move
    Not very realistic or elegant
    Makes it easy to stop prime sector creation

Can pieces swap positions, passing through each other?
    Yes. Trying to resolve this would add complexity.

1. Red orders
2. Blue orders
3. Pieces move

Force game ending?


Hover center:
    Same as hovering every sector
Click center:
    If no sectors are selected, select all sectors, including ghost sectors
    If sectors are selected, deselect all sectors
Drag center:
    Gives an order to move the selected sectors, or if none are selected, order all sectors including ghost sectors
Hover sector:
    If the sector bit is on, show a faint glowing border.
    If the sector bit is off, show a faint ghost sector border.
Mousedown sector (including ghost sectors):
    Add move event listener
Mousemove sector > 10px:
    If no sectors are selected, select this and drag it, locked in its direction.
    If sectors are selected, drag them, locked in their directions.
Mouseup sector:
    If sector was dragged, snap to nearest cell.
    If sector was not dragged, toggle the selectedness of the sector.

Sending an order:
    Starting at the prime sectoid, flood fill consecutive territories:
        Light and then gradually fade them to their original color
Receiving an order:
    Sectoid center lights then gradually fades to its original color
Moving:
    If the sectors can move without passing through the remaining sectors, move them. Otherwise, float up and move.

        To win, you must create a prime sectoid on your opponents half

Gameplay matrix:
    When:
        Move after all players have ordered
        Move after each player orders
        Move after any player calls it
    Which:
        Execute all orders
        Execute orders created by the current player
        Execute orders on sectoids on the current players territory

A strategy contains either:
    The position offset (which piece to move)
    The time offset (when to start moving)
    A 8-bit mask of sectors to move
    The direction to move
    The distance to move
Or:
    A list of other strategies

Each move, you may:
    Create or select a strategy and immediately move it
    Create or select a strategy and add it to another strategy

Dont allow saving strategies, because this would allow creating an implosion strategy or another complex strategy, and executing it whenever. There's no opportunity for the opponent to disrupt things when he sees you not doing anything visibly.
